# Terraria Activity Tracker
This is a small JavaFX program meant for showing what bosses and events you have completed so far. This is primarily meant to be displayed on a livestream layout so viewers just tuning in can quickly figure out how far you have progressed. The program has a solid navy background, which should allow it to be chrome-keyed out using a filter.
## Controls
The app used the F2-F6, the edit keys, control, and shift for toggling the state of the icons. (Automatically reading the state from the running game is beyond my skill level). By default, the events are hidden; the window can be resized to show them.
