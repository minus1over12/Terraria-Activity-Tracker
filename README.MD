# Terraria Activity Tracker
This is a small JavaFX program meant for showing what bosses and events you have completed so far. This is primarily 
meant to be displayed on a livestream layout so viewers just tuning in can quickly figure out how far you have 
progressed. The program has a solid magenta background, which should allow it to be chrome-keyed out using a filter.
## Controls
If you have used compose key before, this app uses a similar concept. If not, do not worry, it is easy to learn. You 
press the magic key, F6, to tell the app that you want to change something; After that, you type in a shorthand version 
of the name of what you just finished to change it in the program. Alternatively, you can also just click the icons of 
things to toggle them.
