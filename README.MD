# Terraria Activity Tracker
This is a small JavaFX program meant for showing what bosses and events you have completed so far. This is primarily meant to be displayed on a livestream layout so viewers just tuning in can quickly figure out how far you have progressed. The program has a solid navy background, which should allow it to be chrome-keyed out using a filter.
## Controls
The app used the F2-F6, the edit keys, control, and shift for toggling the state of the icons. (Automatically reading the state from the running game is beyond my skill level).
